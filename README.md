## About

With the cl_khr_gl_sharing extension to the OpenCL API, we can do a zero copy share of the automata data and the rendered textures. This speeds up the sim quite significantly, getting 1500 cycles per second on a 1920x1080 grid of single pixel cells

### Features

* .rle decoder
* GUI tool to change cycle rate and select one of over 1500 patterns as shown on http://www.conwaylife.com/
